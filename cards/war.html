          <p id="paragraph">Our experience and expertise in web sales and e-commerce gives us a backing to provide solutions that are currently lacking in the market. There is an all-time high demand for web development and marketing for small businesses with signs of rising further. Interestingly, few web developers have taken advantage of this opportunity, leaving the industry with no dominant participants.<br>

The high costs of the projects and the focus on bigger companies and institutions could be the contributing factor as to why this market remains untapped. We have a system that will reduce the project costs dramatically giving us the opportunity to offer quality services at reduced costs. We have prepared this business plan to highlight some of the aspects of our business and systems. It details the market demands and growth, and outlines the projected profit margins and <br> 
<p id="paragraph">cash flow over the next years.</p>

<p id="paragraph">
The fact that our services target small businesses gives us an edge over our competitors. By setting up strategic alliances with some of the web and Internet-related companies, we will offer our customers efficient and affordable web services that will meet their demands.
The most notable trend in the industry currently is the mass migration online. Small businesses are either waiting to migrate or are looking to upgrade their already existing sites to suit the rapidly changing industry.
Major businesses and companies are also taking their daily operations to the internet. Office tasks and general business operations have moved to the web, and we expect more to develop out of this
